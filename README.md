# Mondrian-Transcription

Hi there! This is a repository for Mondrian Transcription Software, an open-source method to  transcribe movement from video. While there are incresaingly many autmoated methods to transcribe movement data from video or collect movement data through indoor positioning technologies, these methods continue to be imprecise and do not foreground the strengths of manual transcription practices that many qualitative researchers value. Mondrian Transcription Software allows you to import a floor plan image and a video file and use an interface to rapidly and manually transcribe movement data (e.g., of people or things) from this video file onto a floor plan. As users interact with the video (e.g., play/pause, rewind or fast-foward), a movement path is created with time, x and y pixel positions that correspond to the video and pixel width/height of the immage. After a user has recorded a complete path corresponding tothe length of a video they can save this movement data as a .CSV file and subsequently recorded another path. Many movement paths can be recorded in this manner and exported for use in a varriety of other tools. Notably, Mondrian Transcription is designed to work with the Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS) - Indoor, an open-source, dynamic visualization tool that provides novel ways to visualize conversation, movement, and audiovisual data over space and time, see: https://benrydal.github.io/IGS-Indoor/

This software is written in JavaScript and p5.js. We are rapidly developing and expanding IGS-Indoor features and collaborators in this effort are welcome. If you have found a bug, you can file it under the “issues” tab. You can also request new features here. For more information on Mondrian Transcription please visit: [insert link]
