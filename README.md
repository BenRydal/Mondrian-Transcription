# Mondrian Transcription Software

## Overview
Hi there! This is a repository for Mondrian Transcription Software, an open-source tool to transcribe fine-grained movement data from video by efficiently tracing the movement of people or things over floor plan representations to generate text files of positioning data — essentially, a transcript of movement. These files can be visualized in software such as the [Interaction Geography Slicer](https://www.benrydal.com/software/igs). We are rapidly developing and expanding features of this tool and collaborators in this effort are welcome. If you have found a bug, you can file it under the “issues” tab. You can also request new features here. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit [Mondrian Transcription](https://www.benrydal.com/software/mondrian-transcription)
